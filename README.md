## Assignment 2 - Computer Vision (CSC8830)

This repository contains solutions to Assignment 2. 
Each assignment are named according to the problem solved for that question 
and includes corresponding Python scripts for implementation.

## Assignments Overview:

1. SSD.py: Script for computing the sum of squared differences (SSD) between SIFT feature vectors of two image patches.
2. Application_2: Extension of Application.py from Assignment 1 with additional integral image and image stitching functions.
3. Canny_Edge.py: Script for manual implementation of Canny edge detection.
4. CannyEdgesDetected: Directory containing images with detected edges using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
5. Checking_SIFT_Availability.py: Script for checking the availability of SIFT feature extraction in OpenCV.
6. Harris_Corner_Detection.py: Script for manual implementation of Harris corner detection.
7. Harris_Corners_Detected: Directory containing images with detected corners using the Harris corner detection algorithm.
8. Homography_Inverse.py: Script for computing the inverse of a homography matrix.
9. homography_matrices.txt: Text file containing homography matrices computed between image pairs.
10. ImageStitch.py: Script for image stitching to create a 360-degree panoramic output.
11. Integral_ImageFeed.py: Script for computing and displaying the integral image feed along with the RGB feed.
12. index.html file to render the output. Please store it in a templates folder in the same directory before executing the application.
